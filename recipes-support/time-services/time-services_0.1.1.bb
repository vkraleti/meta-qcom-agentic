SUMMARY = "Time-services Daemon to sync time from Modem to APPS"
DESCRIPTION = "Updates system time from modem when network-camped. Operates independently \
and does not synchronize with systemd-timesyncd, NTP, or chrony. If multiple time sources \
are active, they may conflict. Future enhancement: integrate as an NTP/chrony time source."

# NOTE: This daemon operates as a standalone time source and does not interact with
# systemd-timesyncd, NTP, chrony, or other time synchronization services. It updates
# the system time only when the modem reports a time update while network-camped.
