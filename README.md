## Introduction

<img align="right" src="https://www.yoctoproject.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2023/10/yoctocompatible1.jpg" alt="Yocto Compatible Project Badge" width="150"/>

OpenEmbedded/Yocto Project hardware enablement layer for Qualcomm based platforms.

This layer provides additional recipes and machine configuration files for
Qualcomm platforms.

This layer depends on:

```text
URI: https://github.com/openembedded/openembedded-core.git
layers: meta
branch: master
revision: HEAD
```

This layer has an optional dependency on meta-oe layer:

```text
URI: https://github.com/openembedded/meta-openembedded.git
layers: meta-oe
branch: master
revision: HEAD
```

The dependency is optional, and not strictly required. When meta-oe is enabled
in the build (e.g. it is used in BBLAYERS) then additional recipes from
meta-qcom are added to the metadata. You can refer to meta-qcom/conf/layer.conf
for the implementation details.

## Branches

- **master:** Primary development branch, with focus on upstream support and
  compatibility with the most recent Yocto Project release.
- **wrynose:** LTS branch based on the Yocto Project 6.0 release, used by
  Qualcomm Linux 2.x.
- **all stable branches up until styhead:** Legacy branches maintained by Linaro,
  prior to the migration to [Qualcomm-linux](https://github.com/qualcomm-linux).

## Machine Support

See `conf/machine` for the complete list of supported devices.

## Generic machine support

All contemporary boards are supported by a single qcom-armv8a machine. It can be
used instead of using the per-board configuration file. In order to enable
support for the particular device extend the qcom-armv8a.conf file.

## Quick build

Please refer to the [Yocto Project Reference Manual](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/system-requirements.html)
to set up your Yocto Project build environment.

Please follow the instructions below for a KAS-based build. The KAS tool offers
an easy way to setup bitbake based projects. For more details, visit the
[KAS documentation](https://kas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

The steps below use `kas-container`, which runs the build inside a container,
so the only host requirements are a container runtime (Docker or Podman) and
the `kas-container` wrapper script — kas, bitbake and the build dependencies do
not need to be installed on the host.

1. Get the `kas-container` script on your `PATH`
   (from [kas-container](https://github.com/siemens/kas/blob/master/kas-container)).

2. Clone meta-qcom layer

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/qualcomm-linux/meta-qcom.git -b master
    ```

3. Build using the KAS configuration for one of the supported boards

    ```bash
    kas-container build meta-qcom/ci/rb3gen2-core-kit.yml
    ```

This reuses the same `ci/<board>.yml` configurations that CI uses. See
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for more advanced usage, including sharing the
`DL_DIR`/`SSTATE_DIR` caches across builds.

> **Note:** To run kas natively on the host instead of in a container, install
> kas by following the
> [kas installation guide](https://kas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/getting-started.html#installation),
> then use `kas build` in place of `kas-container build` in the steps above.

For a manual build without KAS, refer to the [Yocto Project Quick Build](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/brief-yoctoprojectqs/index.html).

## Flash

For instructions on building the QDL tool, preparing the board, and flashing
images over USB (EDL mode), see [Flashing images](docs/flashing.md).

## Security recommendations for production

Please refer to the security recommendations for production builds documented here:
[Security Recommendations](docs/security-recommendations.md)

## Releases

Milestone releases for meta-qcom are managed directly in this repository
using git tags. Each release tag captures the exact state of the layer for
that milestone, ensuring reproducible and stable builds. The list of available
release tags can be found on the
[meta-qcom tags page](https://github.com/qualcomm-linux/meta-qcom/tags).

To build a specific release, clone the repository at the desired release tag and
build it with KAS using the configuration for your target machine and distro.

1. Clone meta-qcom at the release tag

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/qualcomm-linux/meta-qcom.git -b <meta-qcom-release-tag>
    ```

   Replace `<meta-qcom-release-tag>` with the tag of the release you want to
   build (see the [tags page](https://github.com/qualcomm-linux/meta-qcom/tags)).

2. Build using the KAS configuration for your machine and distro

    ```bash
    kas build meta-qcom/ci/<machine>.yml:meta-qcom/ci/<distro>.yml
    ```

   Replace `<machine>` with the target board and `<distro>` with the desired
   distro configuration. For example:

    ```bash
    kas build meta-qcom/ci/rb3gen2-core-kit.yml:meta-qcom/ci/qcom-distro.yml
    ```

   Refer to `meta-qcom/ci/` for the complete list of available machine and
   distro configurations.

## Contributing

Please submit any patches against the `meta-qcom` layer (branch **master**)
by using the GitHub pull-request feature. Fork the repo, create a branch,
do the work, rebase from upstream, and create the pull request.

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the contribution workflow
and the commit subject and message requirements before opening a pull request.

Branch **kirkstone** is not open for direct contributions, please raise an
issue with the suggested change instead.
